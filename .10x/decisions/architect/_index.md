## How the Phase 0 design was produced

Judge panel of three independent designs (ship-fast / integrity-first / evolution-ready), scored by three judges (DO operations, poker integrity, solo-founder build order); the winner's eight load-bearing assumptions were adversarially checked against Cloudflare and Supabase docs and against this repo (including measured CPU timings of `analyzeSpot` under workerd). One claim was refuted (`@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` is deprecated; use `@cloudflare/vitest-plugin`), several were corrected in detail. The architect reviewed the synthesis and added `commitment` to `SeatView` and the avatar-debt note.

## Cross-cutting principles

1. **The engine is pure and injected.** `src/engine/` has no RNG, no clock, no DOM, no Node globals. The deck is an input; shuffling and secrets happen in `worker/src/`. This is what makes duplicate matches, replay, review and the verify consumer trivial.
2. **One serializer.** Every byte a client sees comes from `seatView()`. The `SeatView` type has no field that could carry another seat's cards, the deck, or analysis. New fields need a redaction test.
3. **Write, then send.** A Durable Object transition is: engine → invariant assert → one atomic `ctx.storage.put` → broadcast. Never broadcast before the durable write. Timeouts use the same path as clients.
4. **Deadlines are data.** One DO alarm, armed at `min(deadlines[].at)`; `alarm()` is idempotent and never throws.
5. **Idempotency keys are per actor.** `act` carries `reqId` + `handNo` + `actionIndex`; staleness is judged against the actor's `actionIndex`, never the table-wide `seq`.
6. **Postgres is an archive, never a dependency of play.** Rows are written only after settlement, through an outbox with retry; the DO is the single live source of truth.
7. **Protocol version = WebSocket subprotocol name.** `qp.v1` today; unsupported → HTTP 426 → reload. Deploy the Worker before the client on breaking changes; the Worker accepts the previous version for one release.
8. **No workspaces, one lockfile.** `worker/` is a directory, not a package. Root `tsconfig` covers `src/engine` and `src/shared`; `worker/tsconfig.json` is a second project with generated `worker-configuration.d.ts` types.
9. **Guards are tests, not promises.** Bundle budget grep for `supabase|src/net/`; `src/net/imports.test.ts` forbids analysis modules; lint bans `Math.random`/timers under `worker/` and `src/engine/`; redaction permutation test; two-socket leak test.
10. **Do not bump Vitest to 5.x** while `@cloudflare/vitest-plugin` peers on `^4.1.0`.
