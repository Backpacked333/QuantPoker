# multiplayer-platform — Phase 0 architecture

## Status / scope

Status: **Decided** 2026-10-08 · Owner: Principal Architect → SDE · Phase 0 of the roadmap in `.10x/status.md`.

Phase 0 delivers: an N-player hold'em engine (2..6 seats) that heads-up runs on from day one; a server-authoritative table service on Cloudflare Durable Objects; Supabase accounts and permanent hand records; a lobby with HU casual quick-match; a live table in the existing React client that reuses `Table`/`ActionBar`; per-hand deck commitment; the integrity-v1 items that cost nothing extra. Exit criterion (from `.10x/status.md`): two browsers play a full HU hand through the deployed Worker, and the engine invariant suite is green for N=2..6.

Not Phase 0 (designed for, not built): duplicate segments and rating (Phase 1), 6-max tables and arenas (Phase 2). Everything below that mentions Phase 1/2 says where the seam is and why Phase 0 does not block it.

## Amendment 2026-10-08 (user decision): one Worker hosts everything

The user created a Git-connected Cloudflare Worker named `quantpoker` (Workers Paid) that already serves the built site, and chose Cloudflare over Vercel for the client. Supersedes every Vercel/`quantpoker-api` reference below:

- **One Worker, `quantpoker`**, configured by `wrangler.jsonc` at the repo root (not `worker/wrangler.jsonc`). `assets.directory: ./dist` serves the Vite build; `run_worker_first: ["/api/*", "/ws/*"]` sends only API and socket traffic to `worker/src/index.ts`. Same origin for page, API and sockets: no CORS, no Origin allowlist (auth is a bearer token, never a cookie, so there is no cross-site socket risk). _2026-10-09, Step 7 (user request): an Origin allowlist was added anyway as defence in depth: `/ws/*` upgrades need the site's own origin; a local server also takes `http://localhost` / `127.0.0.1` pages (`worker/src/index.ts`)._
- **Deploys come from Cloudflare's Git integration** (`npm run build` then `npx wrangler deploy`), not from a GitHub Actions `deploy-worker.yml`. No Cloudflare API token is needed in GitHub.
- **Client configuration is served at runtime** by `GET /api/config` (the Supabase URL and publishable key from `wrangler.jsonc` `vars`). The build needs no environment variables. `VITE_SUPABASE_*` still overrides for local Vite development.
- **Dev tokens are `dev.<userId>.<secret>`** (the original `dev:` form contains `:`, which browsers reject in a WebSocket subprotocol).
- **Supabase** moved to the user's Pro org "Quant Poker" with the same project ref, keys and data.
- Vercel is retired for this app.

## Amendment 2026-10-10: Phase 1 rated heads-up (P1-00)

What P1-01…P1-04 and P1-12 build. The inputs:

- Q1 is answered **B** by the user (2026-10-09).
- Q2 takes the tickets' recommendation ("immediately"). The user has not answered it; the choice is one rule in `deadlines.ts` and is reversible.
- R-8, R-9, R-11, R-13, R-14 and R-15 come from `.10x/tickets.md`.
- The schema is the DBA's `.10x/decisions/dba/phase1-schema.md`.

Everything not listed here works as in Phase 0.

| Deck rule (Q1)                | A fresh CSPRNG deck and a fresh commitment secret every hand, exactly as casual: `RatedController` is `LocalController` with the rated config. No deck is reused, so nothing about a later hand can be inferred from an earlier one, and the commitment scheme is unchanged                                                                                                                                                                  | Same-pair duplicate (A): segment 2 replays segment 1's decks and leaks the opponent's cards to anyone who remembers or reviews. Cross-pair (C): needs four players queued at once |
| Luck                          | `src/engine/luck.ts` (P1-02, built). An all-in pot with cards to come is settled at exact equity. The match result is the sum of adjusted nets. The adjustment runs in the `nextHand` alarm (and at match end for the last hand), from the stored final hand. It is deterministic, so a restart recomputes it, and the showdown frame is never delayed (a preflop all-in costs ≈ 0.5 s, inside the 3 s gap)                                  | Compute before sending `hand_end`: delays the showdown by up to 0.5 s.

| Match length and clock (R-11) | 40 hands, button alternating, stacks reset to 100 bb each hand. 20 s per decision, plus a 60 s bank per half: the bank resets at hand 21. The halves exist only for the clock                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | One 40-hand stretch with a 120 s bank: changes the PM's per-segment rule. 20 hands: noisier results with fresh decks                                                              |
| Draw band (R-8)               | `DRAW_BAND_BB = 2`, inclusive, applied to the **luck-adjusted** total: \|adjusted\| ≤ 40 chips at 10/20 is a draw                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Applying it to the actual net: reintroduces the luck B removes                                                                                                                    |
| Disconnect                    | A 60 s grace from the socket closing. After it, each of the absent seat's turns auto-acts at once (check if possible, else fold) and counts as a timeout.

| Storage in `TableDO`          | As Phase 0: `match`, `deadlines`, the live `deck:<n>`, `outbox:*`, `parked:*`. `match` gains, per seat, `adjusted` (luck-adjusted chips) and a per-half bank. `hands.record` gains `luck: { allInAt, equity, adjustedBySeat }` for rated hands; at an all-in showdown both hands are shown, so nothing hidden is published. A rated match stays under 10 kB                                                                                  | Per-hand luck rows in the DO: the record already carries them to Postgres                                                                                                         |
| Rating update (P1-12)         | At match end the outbox queues `outbox:9999:rate` after `9999:end`. Flushing it reads both rows from `ratings` (version and `last_match_at`), applies `idle()` for the 30-day periods, rates with `rateMatch` (`src/rating/glicko2.ts`, built), and calls `apply_rating` with the versions read. On 40001 it re-reads and recomputes (at most 3 times per flush). `rating_history_once` makes a repeat a no-op. Void matches are never rated | Rating inside Postgres: Glicko-2 in PL/pgSQL, untestable against the published example                                                                                            |
| Grading flow (P1-09)          | The same `HAND_QUEUE` message `{ matchId, handNo }`. The consumer verifies first; a verified rated hand is then graded and written with `record_grades`. A failure retries, then dead-letters to an incident. It never blocks the next hand, the result or the rating                                                                                                                                                                        | A second queue: one more binding, the same ordering                                                                                                                               |

**Failure matrix.**

- **DO restart mid-match:** state is written before frames are sent (Phase 0). The adjusted totals and banks live in `match`, and a pending adjustment is recomputed from the stored hand.
- **One player gone:** grace, then immediate auto-actions; three in a row forfeit.
- **Both gone:** void.
- **Supabase down at match end:** the end screen shows the luck-adjusted result at once and "rating updates when the archive catches up". The outbox delivers match, hands, end, then rate, in order.
- **A call refused for its data:** parked after 12 refusals with an incident (S7-13).

**Phase 1 migrations,** reconciled with `phase1-schema.md`, in the order the tickets ship them:

1. S7-05 telemetry, `record_match` v3.
2. P1-01 `rated_matches`, `record_match` v4.
3. P1-04 `rematch`, `record_match` v5.
4. P1-12 `ratings`.
5. P1-09 `hand_grades`.
6. P1-10 `accuracy`.
7. P1-14 `ladder` v1.
8. P1-16 `profile_views`.
9. P1-17 `reports`.
10. P1-18 `sanctions` and `ladder` v2.

Every table named in P1-01…P1-18 is in that list. One disagreement, resolved here: the proposal's `match_players.segment_chips` has no meaning under B, so it becomes `adjusted_chips` (the luck-adjusted net). `outcome` comes from it with the draw band. `supabase/proposed/phase1.sql` is updated to match.

**Corrections to this ADR where the code differs.**

- `TableController` is a synchronous `nextHandPlan(handNo, config)` with no `onHandEnd` or `onSeatEvent`.
- `Deadline` kinds are `turn`, `nextHand`, `outbox`, `start` and `idle` (S7-01).
- The `DuplicateController` and `deck:<n>` retention below are superseded by Q1 = B.

## Context and constraints (brief; reference the PM files rather than repeating them)

- Requirements: `.10x/decisions/product-manager/multiplayer-platform.md` (P0 list, metrics), `heads-up-duplicate-ladder.md` (format Phase 0 must not block), `six-max-tables.md` (N-player engine required now), `integrity-and-trust.md` (v1 protections), `_index.md` (principles; `[DISCOVERED]` state of the code).
- Fixed by the user, not relitigated here: Cloudflare Workers + Durable Objects + alarms + WebSockets; Supabase project `quantpoker` (`dbkfuxczfkawxqmaieii`, us-east-1, Postgres 17) for auth and data with JWTs verified in the Worker; Vercel static client with hash routing; solo builder, 2–3 weeks, managed services only; play money; heads-up on the N-player engine; duplicate designable without protocol change; integrity v1 (server-only truth, no foreign hole cards or deck before showdown, CSPRNG shuffle, deck commitment, no analysis mid-hand on rated tables, abandonment counted); the Atlas trainer, its gates and the 150 kB gzip entry budget stay unchanged.
- Existing code this design respects: `src/lib/poker.ts` (`Player = 0 | 1`, immutable `act()` via `structuredClone`, `legalActions()` returning `{toCall, canCheck, canRaise, minRaiseTo, maxRaiseTo}`, `HistoryEntry`, bets capped at the effective stack, no side pots); `src/lib/sim.ts` (integer card ids `toId`/`fromId`, bitmask `score()`, `lcg`); `src/lib/random.ts` + `src/env.ts` (`?seed=` seam); `src/lib/range.ts` + `src/lib/equity.worker.ts` (`SpotRequest`, `analyzeSpot`); `src/lib/grading.ts`/`model.ts` (`gradeDecision`, `heroContext`); `src/state/trainer.ts` (`trainerReducer`), `src/state/spots.ts` (`useSpots`, `spotKey`); `src/App.tsx` (`parseRoute`, the Atlas `setTimeout` loop at lines 306–322, `blocked = welcome || tour || view !== 'play'`, the `presets` memo at line 391); `src/components/table/Table.tsx`, `ActionBar.tsx`; `src/lib/storage.ts` (`SyncAdapter`, untouched); `scripts/check-bundle.mjs` (entry chunk currently 140.9 of 150 kB).
- Non-functional targets: ~300 registered in 90 days, dozens concurrent; ack→render p95 < 150 ms in-region; reconnect within 60 s keeps the seat; 0 chip-conservation/side-pot failures; tens of dollars per month.

## Decision summary (10-15 bullets, each one decision)

1. **New engine, old engine untouched.** `src/engine/` is a new pure N-player engine with the deck injected (`startHand(config, deck)`); `src/lib/poker.ts` keeps driving the Atlas trainer in Phase 0 and is the N=2 oracle in a differential test. The trainer migrates in Phase 2 with the N-seat `Table`.
2. **No workspaces.** One root `package.json`, one lockfile, one `npm ci`. `worker/` is a directory with its own `wrangler.jsonc`, `tsconfig.json` and `vitest.config.ts`, not a package; shared code is imported by relative path (`../../src/engine/hand.ts`) and bundled by wrangler's esbuild (verified).
3. **Two Durable Object classes in one Worker:** `TableDO` (one per match; owns the live hand, deck, sockets, clock, outbox) and `LobbyDO` (singleton: persisted queue, one-active-table map, pair limiter, presence). Both SQLite-backed (`new_sqlite_classes`), both using the KV-style `ctx.storage` API, WebSocket Hibernation API, DO alarms. No `setTimeout` in `worker/` (lint-enforced).
4. **Full redacted snapshots, not deltas.** Every server frame carries a monotonic `seq`; `welcome`/`state` carry the whole `SeatView` (< 1 kB at HU). Reconnect and resync are "send the latest snapshot". Redaction lives in one function, `seatView()` in `src/engine/redact.ts`, tested by key allowlist and by a permutation property test.
5. **Idempotent actions.** `act` carries `reqId`, `handNo`, `actionIndex`; a repeat `reqId` re-sends the acknowledging `state`; a stale `actionIndex` is rejected with `error stale` plus a snapshot. Timeouts go through the same `applyAction` path. Write-then-send: engine transition → invariant assert → one atomic multi-key `ctx.storage.put` → broadcast.
6. **Deadlines are data.** `TableDO` stores `deadlines: Deadline[]` and arms the single DO alarm at `min(at)`; `alarm()` applies every due entry idempotently and re-arms. Turn clock, next-hand timer, no-show, idle cleanup and outbox retry share this one mechanism.
7. **Per-slot salted deck commitment, partial reveal.** `commitment = sha256(leaf_0‖…‖leaf_51)`, `leaf_i = sha256(salt_i ‖ card_i)`, `salt_i = HMAC-SHA256(handSecret, i)[0..16]`. `hand_start` carries the commitment; after the hand a separate `reveal` message carries all 52 leaves plus `(slot, card, salt)` for board slots and shown hole slots only. Unshown cards never leave the DO except into `hands_private` (no RLS policies). A fresh `handSecret` per hand means Phase 1 duplicate segments never share a commitment.
8. **Auth: Supabase ES256 JWT verified with `jose` + `createRemoteJWKSet`; the token travels in `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: qp.v1, bearer.<jwt>`**, never in the URL. The subprotocol name is the protocol version (unsupported → HTTP 426 → client reloads). No HS256 branch (verified: the project publishes one ES256 key). No tickets, no anonymous accounts.
9. **Postgres is the archive, the DO is the only live state.** `hands` rows (public, no deck, no unshown cards) are inserted only after settlement through a `record_hand(jsonb)` SQL function called from a DO outbox with retry; `hands_private` holds deck + secret + all hole cards with no RLS policies; `hand_holes` gives each user their own cards under RLS.
10. **Grading (Phase 1) runs in a Cloudflare Queue consumer in the same Worker, `max_batch_size: 1`.** Phase 0 ships the queue, a verify-only consumer (replay + commitment + chip conservation → `hands.verified`), and `bench.test.ts` with measured numbers (flop ≈ 80–200 ms CPU per decision).
11. **Client: lazy `src/net/` chunk, new store, `Table`/`ActionBar` reused through `toHeroGame`.** No `trainerReducer` reuse. Two additive, defaulted props on `Table` and two on `ActionBar`; `buildPresets` extracted from `App.tsx` into `src/lib/presets.ts`. The live chunk never imports `state/spots.ts`, `lib/range.ts`, `lib/grading.ts`, `lib/model.ts`, `lib/atlas.ts` (test-enforced); the protocol has no field that can carry analysis.
12. **Chips and stacks:** integer chips, blinds `10/20`, every hand starts at `2000` (100 bb), stacks reset each hand (`stackPolicy: 'reset'`, the duplicate rule, also simplest). Same numbers as the trainer so formatting and the oracle line up. The UI labels bb.
13. **Showdown reveals every non-folded hand (no muck) in Phase 0**; it is recorded as `shown` from the first hand so the choice is in the data.
14. **Build order:** engine (no UI) → Supabase + sign-in → `TableDO` + invite-by-link harness → live table (milestone, day 10) → clocks/commitment/records → lobby → hardening/CI/deploy. 15 working days, 3 in reserve.
15. **Plan: Workers Paid ($5/month).** Free would work for the features but not for the CPU limit (10 ms) the queue consumer needs nor the daily DO duration at ~1k hands/day.

Sharing and type-checking. The root `tsconfig.json` already has `"include": ["src", …]`, so `src/engine` and `src/shared` are strict-checked and linted by the existing `npm run typecheck` / `npm run lint` with no change. `worker/tsconfig.json` is a second project checked by a new script `typecheck:worker` (`tsc -p worker/tsconfig.json`); its `lib: ["ES2022"]` plus the generated `worker-configuration.d.ts` (which declares `structuredClone`, `crypto`, `WebSocket`, `DurableObject`) is the mechanical guarantee that nothing in `src/engine`, `src/shared` or `worker/src` touches `window`, `document` or Node globals (`types` is set explicitly so `@types/node` is not auto-included). Verified: root `tsc -b` ignores `worker/` entirely, so this step must exist or the Worker is never type-checked. Wrangler bundles `../../src/engine/*.ts` imports with no extra config (verified with a dry run; the emitted bundle contained `score`, `newHand`, `legalActions`).

`package.json` changes: dependencies `@supabase/supabase-js`, `jose`; devDependencies `wrangler`, `@cloudflare/vitest-plugin` (not the deprecated `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers`); scripts `worker:dev` (`wrangler dev --config worker/wrangler.jsonc --port 8787`), `worker:test` (`vitest run --config worker/vitest.config.ts`), `worker:deploy`, `worker:types`, `typecheck:worker`, `engine:soak` (`ENGINE_SOAK=1 vitest run src/engine/engine.test.ts`). `vite.config.ts` `test.exclude` adds `'worker/**'` (verified: without it the root jsdom run collects `worker/**/*.test.ts` and `cloudflare:workers` cannot resolve). `eslint.config.js`: add `worker/.wrangler`, `worker/dist*` to `ignores`; add a block for `['worker/**/*.ts', 'src/engine/**/*.ts']` with `no-restricted-globals: ['setTimeout', 'setInterval']` and `no-restricted-properties: [{ object: 'Math', property: 'random' }]`. `.gitignore`: `worker/.wrangler/`, `worker/.dev.vars`.

Bundle budget. Everything networked is reachable only from `const LiveApp = lazy(() => import('./net/LiveApp'))` in `App.tsx`; the entry chunk grows by two route regexes and a nav button. `scripts/check-bundle.mjs` gets a second check: fail if the entry chunk source matches `/supabase|createRemoteJWKSet|src\/net\//`, so the promise is enforced, not assumed.

## Engine: N-player generalisation (types, state shape, side pots algorithm, positions/blinds for N=2 vs N>2, action legality, showdown award order, odd-chip rule, all-in runout, immutability; which existing functions/tests are kept, renamed or replaced; invariant/property test list)

Decision (handoff Q1): new engine, same style as `poker.ts`. The old `Game` shape (`cards: [Card[], Card[]]`, `stacks: [number, number]`, `result.net` hero-relative) is read by `grading.ts`, `model.ts`, `atlas.ts`, `trainer.ts`, `spots.ts`, `Table.tsx`, `ActionBar.tsx`, `HandReview.tsx`, `runout.ts`, `showdown.ts`; generalising it in place would touch ~15 modules and the trainer must stay unchanged. Cards on the engine side are integer ids from `src/lib/sim.ts` (`toId`/`fromId`); the evaluator is `score()` from `sim.ts`, imported directly (it only type-imports `poker.ts`, so it bundles clean for workerd, verified).

```ts
// src/engine/types.ts
export type SeatId = number // absolute seat 0..5
export type Street = 'preflop' | 'flop' | 'turn' | 'river' | 'showdown'
export type PlayerAction =
  | { type: 'fold' }
  | { type: 'check' }
  | { type: 'call' }
  | { type: 'raise'; to: number }
export type HandConfig = {
  handNo: number
  seats: { seat: SeatId; stack: number }[] // seated players, ascending seat
  button: SeatId
  blinds: { sb: number; bb: number }
}
export type SeatState = {
  seat: SeatId
  stack: number
  bet: number
  invested: number
  folded: boolean
  allIn: boolean
  actedSeq: number // -1 = not acted this street
  cards: [number, number] | null // null only in a redacted view

}
export type HandAction = {

  street: Exclude<Street, 'showdown'>
  boardCount: number
  amount: number

  pot: number
  canRaise: boolean // same fields as poker.ts HistoryEntry
}
export type Pot = { amount: number; eligible: SeatId[] }
export type Award = { pot: number; seat: SeatId; amount: number; score: number }
export type LegalActions = {
  seat: SeatId
  toCall: number
  canCheck: boolean
  canRaise: boolean
  minRaiseTo: number
  maxRaiseTo: number
}
export type HandState = {
  config: HandConfig
  street: Street
  board: number[]
  deck: number[] // all 52 slots; dealt by index, never popped; -1 marks an unknown slot in a review replay
  players: SeatState[]
  toAct: SeatId | null
  lastRaise: number // size of the last full raise this street; bb at street start
  raiseSeq: number // incremented by every full raise; a seat may raise iff actedSeq < raiseSeq
  actions: HandAction[]
  pots: Pot[] // rebuilt at every round close
  result?: {
    awards: Award[]
    netBySeat: Record<SeatId, number>
    showdown: boolean
  }
}
```

API (`src/engine/hand.ts`), all pure, `act` clones with `structuredClone` exactly like `poker.ts:296`:

- `startHand(config, deck): HandState`. Deal slots are fixed (`dealSlots(config)` in `deck.ts`): hole cards round-robin, one card per pass, starting at the first seat clockwise from the button (so slot 0 is that seat's first card, slot N is its second), then the board at slots `2N..2N+4`, no burn. Blinds are posted `min(blind, stack)` as `contribute` does today. If posting leaves at most one player not all-in, the hand runs out immediately (mirrors `newHand`'s runout check).
- `legalActions(state): LegalActions` for `state.toAct`. `toCall = min(currentBet - bet, stack)`; `canCheck = toCall === 0`; `maxRaiseTo = min(bet + stack, max over other non-folded seats of (bet + stack))` (the largest opponent total; raising beyond it is pointless and online rooms cap there; at N=2 this is exactly `poker.ts`'s effective-stack cap, which is why the oracle below asserts full equality of `legalActions`); `canRaise = street !== 'showdown' && maxRaiseTo > currentBet && (actedSeq < raiseSeq)`; `minRaiseTo = min(maxRaiseTo, currentBet + lastRaise)`.
- `act(state, seat, action): HandState` throws `EngineError` on wrong seat, on anything outside `legalActions`, or on a non-integer raise, leaving the input untouched. Records a `HandAction` with the decision context (`toCall`, `pot`, `canRaise`, `boardCount`) as `poker.ts` does, so Phase 1 grading needs no stored snapshots.
- Full vs short raise: a raise whose increment `to - currentBet >= lastRaise` sets `lastRaise` to the increment and bumps `raiseSeq` (everyone may act again); a smaller raise is only legal when it is the raiser's all-in and does not change `lastRaise` or `raiseSeq`, so seats that already acted may only call or fold (TDA short all-in rule). Round closes when no seat must act, where a seat must act iff not folded, not all-in and (`bet < currentBet` or `actedSeq < 0`). Then `returnUncalled` refunds the part of the highest bet nobody matched, `buildPots` runs, and either the next street starts (`lastRaise = bb`, `actedSeq = -1`, `raiseSeq = 0`) or, if fewer than two seats are not all-in, the board runs out and showdown is evaluated (`result.showdown = true`, all non-folded `shown = true` before the runout so clients can animate it).
- `isOver(state)`, `replayHand(config, deck, actions): HandState[]` (state before each action plus final; throws if it ever reads a `-1` slot, which doubles as a record integrity check), `assertInvariants(state, chipsInPlay)`.

Positions and blinds (`positions.ts`). N=2: button posts SB, acts first preflop and last postflop (identical to `newHand`: `turn: dealer`, then `other(dealer)` after `nextStreet`). N≥3: SB = next seat clockwise from the button, BB = next, UTG = next acts first preflop; postflop the first non-folded, non-all-in seat clockwise from the button. `positionNames(n, button)` yields BTN/SB/BB/UTG/HJ/CO for the UI. `nextButton(prev, seated)` in Phase 0 simply alternates/advances to the next seated seat; the dead-button rule is documented in `positions.ts` and implemented in Phase 2 (six-max-tables asks the architect to pick: **forward-moving button, dead small blind** — the button moves to the next seated player every hand; if the player who should post the SB left, the SB is dead and the BB is posted by the next seated player; nobody posts two blinds).

Side pots (`pots.ts`). `buildPots(players)`: levels = ascending distinct `invested` among non-folded seats; for each level, every seat (folded included) contributes `min(invested, level) - min(invested, prevLevel)`; eligibility = non-folded seats with `invested >= level`. `pots[0]` is the main pot. `referencePots` is a chip-by-chip allocator used only as a test oracle. Showdown: `score([...cards, ...board], 7)` per eligible seat per pot; ties split evenly; odd chips go one each to tied winners clockwise starting from the first seat after the button (at N=2 that is the BB, exactly `settle()`'s `game.pot % 2` to `other(game.dealer)`). Award order emitted in `result.awards`: last side pot first, main pot last (dealer procedure; the client animates in that order). Fold-win: no cards revealed. `result.netBySeat[seat] = payout - invested`.

Invariant test plan (`src/engine/engine.test.ts`, seeded with `lcg` from `sim.ts`, same random policy as `poker.test.ts` 'conserves chips and terminates over 500 randomized games': 12% fold, 38% random-size raise when allowed, else check/call; 10k hands per N in CI, 100k with `ENGINE_SOAK=1`; stacks 1..4000 chips so forced short blinds occur):

1. Chip conservation after every `act`: `Σ stack + Σ bet + Σ pots.amount === Σ starting stacks`; after settlement `Σ stack === Σ starting`.
2. 52 distinct ids across `players[*].cards ∪ board ∪ undealt`; stacks non-negative integers.
3. Legality: every action the walk takes comes from `legalActions`; additionally a 10% stream of deliberately illegal messages (raise below min/above max, check facing a bet, call with no bet, wrong seat, non-integer) must throw and leave the input `toEqual` its pre-call clone.
4. Pots: `Σ pots.amount === Σ invested`; no folded seat is eligible; eligibility is monotone across levels; `buildPots` equals `referencePots`; every award goes to an eligible seat; per-pot payouts sum to the pot; odd chips fewer than winners and placed on the first winner clockwise from the button.
5. Termination within 200 actions.
6. Showdown oracle: winners per pot recomputed with the slow reference evaluator already in `src/lib/engine.test.ts`.
7. `replayHand(config, deck, actions)` reproduces the final state byte-for-byte via `JSON.stringify`.
8. Crafted cases: three-way all-in with three stack sizes; short all-in that does not reopen action; a full raise after a short all-in that does; uncalled bet refund when the only caller is short; odd-chip assignment; blinds larger than a stack; 6-way split pot; big-blind option after limps.

Differential oracle (`differential.test.ts`, 10k seeded HU hands): build the old `Game` with `newHand(id, stacks, dealer, lcg(seed))` with stacks in `[40, 4000]` (both ≥ 2 bb so blinds post in full in both engines); build the new deck from the old game by placing `game.cards[other(dealer)][0], game.cards[dealer][0], game.cards[other(dealer)][1], game.cards[dealer][1]` in slots 0–3 and `game.deck.slice(-5).reverse()` in slots 4–8 (the old engine pops the board from the end), remaining cards after; drive both with the same action sequence drawn from the old engine's `legalActions`; after every step assert equal `stacks`, `bets`, `pot`/`Σ pots`, `board`, winner and hero `net`, and equal `legalActions` including `maxRaiseTo` (equal by construction of the cap rule). Short-blind hands (stack < 20) are excluded from the oracle because `newHand` posts both blinds at `min(blind, effective)` while the N-player engine posts `min(blind, own stack)`; they are covered by crafted cases with hand-computed expectations instead.

Kept, renamed, replaced: `src/lib/poker.ts` and `poker.test.ts` are kept verbatim; `src/lib/engine.test.ts`'s reference evaluator is reused from the new tests via import; nothing is renamed. `shuffle`, `deck()`, `newHand` remain the trainer's; `src/engine/deck.ts` has its own `orderedDeck()` of ids and `shuffleWith(randomInt)`.

## Durable Objects (each class: responsibilities, id scheme, storage layout with SQLite tables or KV keys, alarms, hibernation, lifecycle; how Phase 1 Match and Phase 2 arena map on)

Both classes `extends DurableObject` from `cloudflare:workers`, declared in `wrangler.jsonc` as `"durable_objects": { "bindings": [{ "name": "TABLE", "class_name": "TableDO" }, { "name": "LOBBY", "class_name": "LobbyDO" }] }` with `"migrations": [{ "tag": "v1", "new_sqlite_classes": ["TableDO", "LobbyDO"] }]` (the storage backend is immutable once created, so this must be SQLite from the first deploy; verified wrangler 4.148 validates it). Both use the KV-style `ctx.storage.get/put/delete/list` (supported on SQLite-backed classes, stored in a hidden table; key+value ≤ 2 MB; a single `put({k1: v1, k2: v2, …})` of up to 128 keys is one atomic write — the write path depends on this). `ctx.storage.sql` is deliberately unused in Phase 0.

### TableDO (one per match)

Id: `env.TABLE.get(env.TABLE.idFromName(matchId), { locationHint: 'enam' })`, `matchId = crypto.randomUUID()` minted by `LobbyDO` or `POST /api/matches`; it is also `matches.id`. The hint only applies on first creation, which is why every creator passes it.

Storage keys: `match` (`{ v: 1, id, config: MatchConfig, kind: 'hu-casual', status: 'waiting' | 'playing' | 'finished', players: { seat, userId, username, connected, disconnectedAt?, bankMs, consecutiveTimeouts }[], handNo, chipsInPlay, result? }`), `hand` (`HandState | null`, includes the deck), `deck:<handNo>` (`{ deck: number[52], secret: string }`, kept for the whole match so Phase 1 segment 2 can reuse `deck:<n - handsPerSegment>` and so the reveal can be re-sent), `seq`, `deadlines` (`Deadline[]`), `lastAck` (`Record<SeatId, { reqId, seq }>`), `timing` (per-action `atMs`, `decisionMs`, `source` for the current hand), `outbox:<n>` (a pending `record_hand`/`record_match`/`release` call with `attempts`). The constructor runs `ctx.blockConcurrencyWhile(() => this.load())` (30 s limit; a throw resets the object) and loads everything but `deck:*` and `outbox:*` into memory.

Sockets: `ctx.acceptWebSocket(ws, [`u:${userId}`, `seat:${seat}`])`, `ws.serializeAttachment({ userId, seat })` (≤ 16 KB, survives hibernation), handlers `webSocketMessage`, `webSocketClose`, `webSocketError`; `ctx.setWebSocketAutoResponse(new WebSocketRequestResponsePair('ping', 'pong'))` so keepalives never wake the object; broadcast = `for (const ws of ctx.getWebSockets()) ws.send(JSON.stringify(seatView(hand, attachment.seat, …)))`. A second socket for the same `userId` closes the first with `4001 replaced`. Rate limit: an in-memory token bucket per socket (20 frames / 5 s; over → close `4429`); more than 5 engine rejections in one hand → close `4400` (the seat keeps its reconnect rights). _As built (Step 7): the bucket is per account per object and a connect spends from it, so reconnecting does not refill it; oversized frames get `too_large` then `4400`; codes are documented in `src/shared/protocol.ts`._ Docs: developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/api/state/ and /api/websockets/.

Write path (the only one; timeouts and clients both call it):

```ts
async applyAction(seat: SeatId, action: PlayerAction, source: 'client' | 'timeout', reqId?: string) {
  const next = act(this.hand!, seat, action)                       // throws → nothing persisted, error frame to sender
  assertInvariants(next, this.match.chipsInPlay)                   // throws → halt() (void hand, reset stacks, incidents row)
  this.hand = next; this.seq++

```

Deadlines (`worker/src/deadlines.ts`): `type Deadline = { kind: 'turn'; at; handNo; actionIndex; seat } | { kind: 'nextHand'; at; handNo } | { kind: 'start'; at } | { kind: 'idle'; at } | { kind: 'outbox'; at; attempt }`. The turn deadline is `now + decisionMs + bankMs[seat]`; when it fires, `bankMs[seat] -= max(0, elapsed - decisionMs)`, then `applyAction(seat, canCheck ? check : fold, 'timeout')` and `consecutiveTimeouts[seat]++` (reset on any client action); three consecutive timeouts end the match as a forfeit with an `abandonments` row (`timeout_x3`). `alarm()` is idempotent: it reloads nothing (memory is authoritative after `load()`), applies each entry whose `at <= now` and whose `handNo`/`actionIndex` still match, drops stale ones, writes `deadlines`, re-arms. Alarms are at-least-once, retried only when the handler throws (max 6, backoff from 2 s), and may be delayed up to a minute during maintenance; the match check makes late or duplicate firings harmless. `alarm()` catches and logs instead of throwing so it never burns the retry budget. Docs: developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/api/alarms/.

Lifecycle: `POST /init` from the Worker (`{ matchId, config, players: [{ seat, userId, username }] }`) → `status: 'waiting'`, `start` deadline `now + 30 s` (no-show: void the table, tell the lobby to put the present player at the head of the queue, `abandonments.no_show` for the absentee). When both seats have an open socket → `startNextHand()`: `plan = await controller.nextHandPlan(handNo)`; `{ commitment, leaves } = commitDeck(plan.deck, plan.secret)`; `hand = startHand(plan.config, plan.deck)`; persist `hand`, `deck:<n>`, `seq`, `deadlines`; send `hand_start` then `state`. On `isOver`: build `HandRecordV1`, send `hand_end`, send `reveal` (when `plan.revealAt === 'hand'`), enqueue `outbox:<n>` with the `record_hand` payload, `HAND_QUEUE.send({ matchId, handNo })` (_as built: an `outbox:<n>:verify` entry sent after that hand's `record_hand` succeeds_), `controller.onHandEnd(record)`, arm `nextHand` (3 s). After `handsPerSegment * segments` hands → `match_end`, `record_match` through the outbox, `LOBBY./release`, `idle` deadline 10 min → `ctx.storage.deleteAll()` once the outbox is empty.

Controller seam (`worker/src/controller.ts`), the Phase 1/2 hook; `TableDO` holds exactly one implementor chosen by `match.kind`:

```ts
export type HandPlan = {
  config: HandConfig
  deck: number[]
  secret: Uint8Array
  revealAt: 'hand' | 'match'
}
export interface TableController {
  nextHandPlan(handNo: number): Promise<HandPlan | null> // null = match over
  onHandEnd(record: HandRecordV1): Promise<void>
  onSeatEvent(e: {
    kind: 'disconnect' | 'reconnect' | 'timeout' | 'forfeit'
    seat: SeatId
  }): Promise<void>
}
```

Phase 0 `LocalController`: CSPRNG deck and fresh secret per hand, button alternates, stacks reset to `startingStack`, `revealAt: 'hand'`. Phase 1 `DuplicateController` (same file, same class, no new DO): for `handNo > handsPerSegment` it loads `deck:<handNo - handsPerSegment>`, swaps the button, mints a **new** secret (so the commitment differs; see Randomness), sums `netBySeat` per `userId` into the match result and writes `matches.result`; the protocol and client are unchanged. Phase 2 6-max: `match.players` grows to 6, `sit`/`stand` messages are added to `ClientMsg`, bots are `players[i].bot = true` entries the DO acts for from a `botTurn` deadline, arenas are an `ArenaDO` implementing `TableController` over RPC. Same `TableDO` class throughout.

### LobbyDO (singleton)

Id: `env.LOBBY.get(env.LOBBY.idFromName('global'), { locationHint: 'enam' })`. Storage keys: `queue:<userId>` (`{ userId, username, since, kind: 'hu-casual', rating: null }`, persisted so hibernation or eviction cannot lose a waiting player, which was the winner design's defect), `active:<userId>` (`matchId`, the one-active-table rule), `pairs:<a>:<b>:<yyyy-mm-dd>` (count; the two-pairings-per-day rule), `seq`. Sockets hibernate with `serializeAttachment({ userId, queued: boolean })`; on wake `ctx.getWebSockets()` plus `storage.list({ prefix: 'queue:' })` reconcile: queue rows whose user has no socket are dropped, so the queue is exactly "connected and asked to play". Pairing runs on every `queue` message and on `webSocketClose` (no periodic alarm while idle, so the object hibernates and costs nothing between players): the two oldest entries whose `pairs` counter is below 2 are matched; the lobby mints `matchId`, calls `TABLE./init`, writes `active:` for both, deletes their `queue:` rows, sends `matched { matchId }`. `TableDO` calls `LOBBY./release { userId[] }` on match end (through its outbox). `presence { online, queued }` is pushed on every change. `GET /api/me` → `{ activeMatch }` lets a client that missed `matched` recover. Phase 1 adds `rating` to the row and a widening-window sort; Phase 2 adds table lists; neither changes a message shape.

## Wire protocol (message types with TypeScript-ish shapes; per-seat redaction rule; seq numbers; idempotency key; resync; errors)

JSON text frames, one socket per table (`wss://<api>/ws/table/<matchId>`) and one per lobby (`wss://<api>/ws/lobby`), opened with `new WebSocket(url, ['qp.v1', 'bearer.' + jwt])`. The server selects `qp.v1`; an unknown version is refused at upgrade with HTTP 426 and the client shows "new version available" and reloads. Types in `src/shared/protocol.ts`; `parseClientMsg(raw): ClientMsg | null` is a hand-written exhaustive validator (`Number.isInteger` on every integer, enum checks, unknown keys rejected, 4 KB frame cap) fuzz-tested with random JSON.

```ts
export const PROTOCOL = 'qp.v1'
export type ClientMsg =
  | {
      t: 'act'
      reqId: string
      handNo: number
      actionIndex: number
      action: PlayerAction
    }
  | { t: 'resync' }
  | { t: 'queue'; kind: 'hu-casual' }
  | { t: 'dequeue' } // lobby socket
export type ErrorCode =
  | 'not_your_turn'
  | 'illegal'
  | 'stale'
  | 'rate_limited'
  | 'replaced'
  | 'halted'
  | 'unauthorized'
export type ServerMsg = { seq: number; matchId: string } & (
  | { t: 'welcome'; seat: SeatId; view: SeatView; serverNow: number } // on every (re)connect; also the resync reply
  | { t: 'state'; view: SeatView; serverNow: number } // after every change
  | {
      t: 'hand_start'
      handNo: number
      commitment: string
      button: SeatId
      blinds: { sb: number; bb: number }
      stacks: number[]
    }
  | { t: 'hand_end'; handNo: number; record: HandRecordV1 } // after settlement only; no deck
  | {
      t: 'reveal'
      handNo: number
      leaves: string
      slots: { slot: number; card: number; salt: string }[]
    }
  | {
      t: 'match_end'
      result: {
        netBySeat: Record<SeatId, number>
        reason: 'complete' | 'forfeit' | 'no_show' | 'engine_fault'
        forfeit?: SeatId
      }
    }
  | { t: 'error'; code: ErrorCode; reqId?: string; message: string }
)
export type LobbyMsg = { seq: number } & (
  | { t: 'queued'; position: number; since: number }
  | { t: 'matched'; matchId: string }
  | { t: 'presence'; online: number; queued: number }
)

export type SeatView = {
  matchId: string
  handNo: number
  you: SeatId
  button: SeatId
  street: Street
  board: number[]
  commitment: string | null // current hand's deck commitment; null between hands (so a reconnect that only sees `welcome` can still verify the reveal)
  match: {
    kind: 'hu-casual'
    status: 'waiting' | 'playing' | 'finished'
    handsTotal: number
    players: {
      seat: SeatId

    }[]
  }
  pot: { total: number; layers: Pot[] }

```

Redaction rule, implemented once in `seatView(state, viewer, extras)`: `players[i].cards = i === viewer ? state.players[i].cards : state.players[i].shown ? state.players[i].cards : null`. `deck`, the hand secret, `raiseSeq`, `actedSeq` and timing never appear; the `SeatView` type has no key that could hold them, and there is no field for equity, EV, ranges or grades, so "no analysis mid-hand" is a property of the schema. Tests: `redact.test.ts` asserts `Object.keys` against a frozen allowlist and, for 10k random states and viewers, that permuting every other seat's hole cards leaves `JSON.stringify(seatView(...))` byte-identical; `worker/test/leak.test.ts` plays scripted hands over two real sockets and asserts no frame to seat 0 contains seat 1's card ids before a `state` whose `players[1].shown` is true.

Sequence and idempotency: `seq` is per table, bumped on every durable change, assigned before the write. The client replaces its store when `seq > last` and drops otherwise. `act` is accepted iff `handNo === hand.config.handNo && actionIndex === hand.actions.length && seat === hand.toAct`; the acknowledgement is the next `state` whose `view.lastReqId === reqId`. A repeated `reqId` equal to `lastAck[seat].reqId` re-sends the current `state` without touching state (so a retry after a reconnect race cannot double-act). An unknown `reqId` with a stale `actionIndex` gets `error stale` plus a fresh `state`. Note: the check is the actor's `actionIndex`, not the table-wide `seq`, so an interleaved reconnect of the opponent never makes a legitimate action stale.

Reconnect: exponential backoff 0.5 → 8 s to the same URL with a fresh access token; the server replaces any older socket for the same `userId` (`4001 replaced`) and sends `welcome`. Pending `reqId`s are forgotten; the snapshot says whether it is still your turn. Clock: the client keeps `clockOffsetMs = serverNow - Date.now()` from the latest `welcome`/`state` and renders `deadline - (Date.now() + offset)`; the server is the only enforcer. Close codes: `4001` replaced, `4400` too many illegal frames, `4409` already seated elsewhere, `4429` rate limited.

## Auth (Supabase JWT verification in the Worker, session binding to a seat, refresh over a long socket, what the client stores)

Client (`src/net/supabase.ts`, inside the lazy chunk): `createClient(import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL, import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_KEY)` with the project's `sb_publishable_…` key. Sign-in: `signInWithOAuth({ provider: 'google' | 'github', options: { redirectTo: location.origin + '/#lobby' } })` (PKCE; the `?code=` lands before the hash and supabase-js exchanges it on load) and `signInWithOtp({ email })` magic links. supabase-js keeps the session in `localStorage` and refreshes the access token in the background (1 h expiry). Before every socket open the client calls `supabase.auth.getSession()` and passes the access token as the second subprotocol, `bearer.<jwt>` (JWT alphabet `A-Za-z0-9-_.` is valid in a subprotocol token; nothing is logged or put in a URL). The client stores nothing else; `AuthGate` renders sign-in when there is no session and a username editor (`profiles.username`) on first visit. Dev/test: if `sessionStorage['qp.devToken']` is set the client sends it instead; production Workers never set `DEV_AUTH_SECRET`, so such a token is simply rejected there.

Worker (`worker/src/auth.ts`):

```ts
const JWKS = createRemoteJWKSet(
  new URL(`${SUPABASE_URL}/auth/v1/.well-known/jwks.json`),
) // module scope: fetches lazily, allowed
export async function verifySupabaseJwt(
  token: string,
  env: Env,
): Promise<{ userId: string }> {
  if (env.DEV_AUTH_SECRET && token.startsWith('dev:')) {
    /* dev:<userId>:<secret> */
  }
  const { payload } = await jwtVerify(token, JWKS, {
    issuer: `${env.SUPABASE_URL}/auth/v1`,
    audience: 'authenticated',
    algorithms: ['ES256'],
  })
  return { userId: payload.sub! }
}
```

Verified against the live project: `GET /auth/v1/.well-known/jwks.json` returns exactly one key, `ES256` P-256, `kid 146bb67a-3a94-457d-b882-dc53d6154404`, cached 10 min by Supabase's edge; jose's default `cacheMaxAge` matches and unknown `kid`s trigger a refetch after a 30 s cooldown. Pinning `algorithms: ['ES256']` prevents alg confusion and rejects the legacy `anon` key (itself an HS256 JWT) if a client ever sends it. There is no HS256 path and the legacy JWT secret is never stored in the Worker. Day-5 checklist item: after the first real sign-in, decode the access token header; if `alg` is `HS256`, rotate to the ES256 key on the dashboard (Project → JWT Signing Keys) rather than adding a secret to the Worker. jose v6 runs in workerd with no `nodejs_compat` (verified).

Upgrade flow: `index.ts` reads `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol`, requires `qp.v1` and one `bearer.` entry, checks `Origin` against `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, verifies, resolves `username` from `profiles` via PostgREST (cached in `caches.default` for 5 min), then forwards to the DO stub with `x-user-id` and `x-username` headers; the DO is unreachable from the internet so it trusts those and binds `{ userId, seat }` into the socket attachment. Every later frame is attributed by the attachment, never by payload. Token lifetime versus long sockets: identity is proven at upgrade; the socket is the credential thereafter; a reconnect is a new upgrade with the refreshed token. Accepted consequence: a user banned mid-match finishes the match. REST endpoints (`/api/matches`, `/api/me`, `/api/telemetry`) are bearer-JWT only, no cookies, so there is no CSRF surface; CORS allows the Vercel origin, the custom domain and `http://localhost:5173`/`4174`. Guests: no anonymous sign-in (rated play needs accounts; the Atlas trainer stays anonymous and never touches Supabase).

Who writes what, when. `TableDO` (service-role key from `wrangler secret put SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, PostgREST `fetch`, no supabase-js in the Worker): `matches` + `match_players` upsert at `/init` (`Prefer: resolution=merge-duplicates`); `rpc/record_hand` once per finished hand; `matches.status/result/finished_at` + `match_players.timeouts/abandoned` + `abandonments` at match end; `incidents` from the halt path. All go through `outbox:<n>` entries flushed by `ctx.waitUntil` right away and retried from the `outbox` deadline with backoff (10 s · 2^attempt, cap 1 h); rows are deleted only after a 2xx; play never waits on Postgres. `worker/src/supabase.ts` treats an empty `SUPABASE_URL` as a sink (keeps the outbox, logs), so tests and CI need no credentials. The queue consumer sets `hands.verified`. Nothing mid-hand ever reaches Postgres.

What stays only in the DO: the live `HandState` (deck included), the hand secret, the queue, sockets, clocks and per-action timings until the hand ends.

Hand record (`HandRecordV1`, public): `{ v: 1, matchId, handNo, segment, config: HandConfig, seats: { seat, userId, username }[], commitment, actions: (HandAction & { atMs, decisionMs, source: 'client' | 'timeout' })[], board, shown: { seat, cards }[], awards, netBySeat, showdown }`. Review rebuilds every intermediate state with `replayHand(record.config, deckFromRecord(record, myHoles), record.actions)` where `deckFromRecord` fills board slots and shown/own hole slots and leaves the rest `-1`; the engine never evaluates a folded seat, so the replay never reads a `-1`. Per-action `decisionMs` and `source` are stored now (integrity v2 telemetry; `abandonments` makes the Phase 1 abandonment score a count query). Phase 1 adds `hand_grades(hand_id, seat, idx, grade, ev_lost, accuracy, model_version)`, `ratings`, `reports` as a purely additive migration; the indexes it needs exist already (`hands (match_id, hand_no)`, `match_players (user_id, match_id)`). Size: a HU record is ~1.9 KB JSON (measured on 3,000 engine hands), leaves 1,664 bytes, reveal ~0.5 KB; ~4 KB per row, so the 500 MB free tier holds ~110k hands.

## Randomness and deck commitment

Shuffle (`worker/src/shuffle.ts`): `randomInt(n)` draws a `Uint32` from `crypto.getRandomValues`, rejects values `>= 2**32 - (2**32 % n)`, returns `x % n`; `shuffleWith(randomInt)` in `src/engine/deck.ts` is Fisher–Yates over the 52 ids. The engine never shuffles and never calls an RNG; tests build decks with `shuffleWith(lcgInt(seed))`. `Math.random` is lint-banned under `worker/` and `src/engine/`.

Commitment (`src/engine/deck.ts`, Web Crypto only, so the same code verifies in the browser and in the queue consumer):

- `handSecret` = 32 random bytes per hand (`crypto.getRandomValues`), stored in `deck:<handNo>` and later `hands_private.secret`.
- `salt_i = HMAC-SHA256(handSecret, uint8(i))[0..16]` (`crypto.subtle.importKey('raw', …, { name: 'HMAC', hash: 'SHA-256' })` + `sign`); HMAC is a PRF, so revealing some salts says nothing about the others.
- `leaf_i = sha256(salt_i ‖ uint8(card_i))`, `commitment = hex(sha256(leaf_0 ‖ … ‖ leaf_51))`.
- `hand_start` carries `commitment` before any `state` frame carries a card. After settlement, `reveal` carries `leaves` (base64, 1,664 bytes) and `slots: [{ slot, card, salt }]` for the board slots and the hole slots of seats with `shown = true`. `verifyReveal(commitment, leaves, slots)` recomputes `sha256(leaves) === commitment` and `sha256(salt ‖ card) === leaves[slot]` per revealed slot; `dealSlots(config)` says which slot each visible card must have come from, so the review view shows "Deck verified" when the dealt cards match the committed slots.
- Why per-slot instead of one hash over the whole deck: a whole-deck reveal with a documented deal order publishes every folded seat's hole cards, which breaks the PM rule "review only reveals cards shown at showdown; never ship unshown cards to any client" (all three candidate designs had this flaw). Per-slot keeps the fairness proof (a re-deal after commitment is detectable) without the leak, and the Fair Play page will say what it does not prove (a biased shuffle). Undealt slots are never revealed.
- Duplicate (Phase 1): segment 2 reuses `deck:<n>` with the button swapped but a **new** `handSecret`; with the same secret the identical commitment would let a player map segment-2 hand _i_ to segment-1 hand _i_ before seeing a card. The remaining memory effect (a shown hand's board recurs) is inherent to the format and recorded in the Phase 1 hand-off. `HandPlan.revealAt: 'match'` is kept as the switch for batching segment-1 reveals to match end if the PM wants it; the default is `'hand'`.

Trainer determinism is untouched: `src/lib/random.ts` (`seedRandom`, `lcg`) and `src/env.ts` (`?seed=`) still drive `newHand`/`atlasDecision`; `e2e/motion.spec.ts` (`/?seed=3`) and `e2e/visual.spec.ts` keep passing because the live chunk never deals. `?seed` has no effect on networked tables by construction; `?motion=off` only affects the `motionOff` render flag.

## Post-hand grading placement (decided, with the CPU-time evidence from verification)

Decision: Phase 1 grading runs in the Cloudflare Queue consumer `queue(batch, env)` of the same Worker (`"queues": { "producers": [{ "binding": "HAND_QUEUE", "queue": "quantpoker-hands" }], "consumers": [{ "queue": "quantpoker-hands", "max_batch_size": 1, "max_retries": 5, "dead_letter_queue": "quantpoker-hands-dlq" }, { "queue": "quantpoker-hands-dlq", "max_batch_size": 10 }] }`), one message per finished hand `{ matchId, handNo }`. Not in `TableDO` (single-threaded; a second of grading would stall the shot clock), not in a Supabase Edge Function (~2 s CPU per request; a hand can exceed it), not trusted from the client (ratings depend on it).

Evidence (verification, Node 22 V8 on a 2.1 GHz Xeon, cold caches per board, `process.cpuUsage`): `analyzeSpot` preflop 15–80 ms, flop 80–200 ms, turn 50–200 ms, river 30–160 ms per decision; one-time `preflopClassEquity` table ≈ 110–200 ms per isolate; the same code ran unchanged under workerd (miniflare, `compatibilityFlags: []`) inside a Worker and a SQLite DO. A HU hand has 2–8 decisions per seat, so 0.5–3 s CPU per hand for both seats. The CPU limit is per consumer **invocation**, i.e. per batch, which is why `max_batch_size` is 1 (ten hands could brush the 30 s default); `limits.cpu_ms` (max 300,000 on Paid, Worker-wide) stays default. `bench.test.ts` runs in Node via `// @vitest-environment node` (deployed Workers freeze `performance.now()` between I/O, so CPU cannot be measured in production) and asserts a cold flop decision < 500 ms. Operations billing: 3 per message, ~90k/month at 1k hands/day, inside the 1M included.

Phase 0 puts in place: the producer/consumer wiring; a verify-only consumer (load `hands` + `hands_private` with the service role, `replayHand` from the full deck, `verifyReveal`, chip conservation, then `hands.verified = true`; a DLQ consumer writes an `incidents` row); `project.ts` in the engine with `toHeroGame(record, seat): Game` and a test that `gradeDecision(game, action, spot, style)` on a projected record equals the trainer's grade for the same `Game` (note `rangeWeights` only reads `history` entries with `player === 1`, so the projection maps the opponent to index 1); `bench.test.ts`. The population opponent model plugs into `policy(equity, context, style, sigma)` in `atlas.ts`, the only call site to generalise.

## Client integration (new state module vs trainerReducer, lazy lobby/network chunk, Table/ActionBar reuse, what stays Atlas-only, routes)

Routes: `parseRoute` in `App.tsx` gains `#lobby` → `{ view: 'live', sub: 'lobby' }`, `#play/<uuid>` → `{ view: 'live', sub: 'table', matchId }`, `#review/<matchId>/<handNo>` → `{ view: 'live', sub: 'review' }`; the nav gets "Play online". `LiveApp` renders under `view === 'live'` inside `Suspense`, like `Curriculum`/`Gallery`. The existing `blocked = welcome || tour || view !== 'play'` already pauses Atlas while you are online.

State: no `trainerReducer` reuse; its messages (`hero`, `atlas`, `deal`, `guess`) are local transitions a networked table does not have. `src/net/store.ts` holds `{ status: 'connecting' | 'open' | 'reconnecting' | 'closed', view: SeatView | null, seq, pendingReqId, lastRecord: HandRecordV1 | null, reveals: Record<number, Reveal>, clockOffsetMs, ackSamples: number[] }` behind `useSyncExternalStore` (same pattern as `useHash` in `src/lib/navigation.ts`); `client.ts` applies `welcome`/`state` by `seq`, exposes `act(action)` which stamps `performance.now()` and records ack→render when the matching `state` commits (samples are batched to `POST /api/telemetry` every 20 actions; this is the p95 metric).

Reuse of `Table`/`ActionBar` through `toHeroGame(view, lastRecord): Game` (in `src/engine/project.ts`, shared with the Phase 1 grading consumer): hero at index 0, opponent at index 1; `cards: [myCards, oppCards ?? [FACE_DOWN, FACE_DOWN]]` (placeholders until `shown`), `stacks`, `bets`, `invested`, `pot: pot.total`, `board` via `fromId`, `dealer: button === you ? 0 : 1`, `turn: toAct === you ? 0 : 1`, `street`, `history` from the public actions in today's `HistoryEntry` shape, `deck: []`, `id: handNo`, `guided: false`, `result: { winner, text, net: netBySeat[you], showdown }`. Additive, defaulted props: `Table` gets `seatNames?: [string, string]` (default `['You', 'Atlas']`, used in the plate, the bubble and the `table-sub` line) and `folded?: Player | null` (replaces the `result?.text.startsWith('Atlas fold')` string check at `Table.tsx:238/349`; default derived from the text so the trainer is unchanged) plus `clock?: { deadline: number; bankMs: number; now: () => number }` rendered by `TurnClock` on the active seat plate; `ActionBar` gets `opponentName?: string` (default `'Atlas'`, "Atlas to act" at `ActionBar.tsx:228`) and `showDeal?: boolean` (default true; false on live tables, the server deals). `legal` comes straight from `view.legal` (same field names as `legalActions`), `math = { revealed: false, ready: false, breakEven }` so `EquityRing` renders its locked state, `guess.show = false`, `presets = buildPresets(legal, pot.total, legal.toCall, bets)` from `src/lib/presets.ts` (the pure part of the memo at `App.tsx:391`; the trainer adds `ev` on top). `useRunout(game)` works unchanged because the server sends the full board with `result.showdown` on an all-in; `faceUpEquity` in `Table` has real opponent cards at that point because all-in runouts mark every live seat `shown`. The sound effect at `App.tsx:332–361` is extracted into `useTableSounds(game, sound)` with no behaviour change so `LiveTable` can reuse it.

What stays Atlas-only and is never imported by `src/net/**`: `lib/atlas.ts`, `state/trainer.ts`, `state/spots.ts`, `lib/range.ts`, `lib/grading.ts`, `lib/model.ts`, `lib/scripted.ts`, `lib/showdown.ts` (except via `Table` after showdown), `components/lab/*`, `LabSheet`, the guess bar. `src/net/imports.test.ts` reads every file under `src/net` and fails on any import of those modules; `scripts/check-bundle.mjs` fails on `supabase` in the entry chunk. Handoff Q7 is settled the PM's way: hide the UI, accept that uniform equity is computable from own cards + board, and log `decisionMs`.

Review of a live hand (`ReviewLive.tsx`): fetches `hands` and `hand_holes` with supabase-js, replays with `replayHand`, renders `HandReview` on `toHeroGame(record, mySeat)` with `graded: false` until Phase 1, shows "Deck verified" from `verifyReveal`, and links each street to the curriculum unit (`#learn/...`) via the existing `LESSON_IDS`.

## Lobby and HU quick-match

`#lobby` shows the three PM cards: **Play 1v1** (quick match; "casual for now"), **6-max tables** (empty state "Coming in Phase 2"), **Practice vs Atlas** (`#table`), plus a small **Play a friend by link** action (see below). Flow: open `/ws/lobby`, send `queue { kind: 'hu-casual' }` → `queued { position, since }`; the client shows the wait timer and, after 60 s with nobody else queued (`presence.queued === 1`), the PM's bail-out ("keep waiting / play Atlas"), client-side only. On `matched { matchId }` both clients navigate to `#play/<matchId>`, open `/ws/table/<matchId>`, and the first hand deals when both sockets are open (30 s no-show rule in `TableDO`). `dequeue` or closing the lobby socket removes the row. One active table per account: `LobbyDO.active:<userId>` is checked on `queue`, on `/api/matches` and at table upgrade (second table → `4409`). Pair limiter: `pairs:<a>:<b>:<day>` < 2.

Invite by link (`POST /api/matches` → `{ matchId }`; the creator is seat 0, the first other account to open `#play/<matchId>` takes seat 1): this is the day-one two-browser harness and ships before the lobby so the milestone does not depend on it. It is shown in the lobby as a secondary action because it also helps cold start; the PM's "no private tables" refers to a persistent feature, and hiding this button is a one-line change if they object (see open questions). Phase 1 adds `rating` to queue rows and a widening window (`|Δ| <= 100 + 50·minutes`), Phase 2 adds table lists and arenas; no message shape changes.

## Local development, testing and CI (wrangler, vitest-pool-workers/miniflare, Playwright with two clients, GitHub Actions changes, deploy steps for Workers/Vercel/Supabase)

Local: `npm run dev` (Vite :5173, unchanged) plus `npm run worker:dev` (`wrangler dev --config worker/wrangler.jsonc --port 8787`; miniflare emulates SQLite DOs, alarms, hibernation and queues). `worker/.dev.vars`: `DEV_AUTH_SECRET=local`, `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (optional; empty = sink mode). Client `.env.development`: `VITE_API_ORIGIN=http://localhost:8787`, `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_KEY`. Supabase: the remote project is used directly (no Docker stack in Phase 0); migrations live in `supabase/migrations/` and are applied with `supabase db push` (or the Supabase MCP `apply_migration`), manually from a checklist, never from CI. Workers secrets: `wrangler secret put SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.

Tests. Engine, shared and `src/net` unit tests run in the existing root Vitest (`npm test`; `bench.test.ts` opts into `node`). Worker tests use `worker/vitest.config.ts`:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config'
import { cloudflareTest } from '@cloudflare/vitest-plugin'
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    cloudflareTest({
      wrangler: { configPath: './wrangler.jsonc' },
      miniflare: { bindings: { DEV_AUTH_SECRET: 'test', SUPABASE_URL: '' } },
      isolatedStorage: false,
    }),
  ],
  test: { include: ['test/**/*.test.ts'], maxWorkers: 1 },
})
```

Verified: `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` is deprecated on npm and its `./config` subpath export is gone (`defineWorkersConfig` throws at config load); `@cloudflare/vitest-plugin@1.3.x` peer-depends on `vitest ^4.1.0`, matching the repo's 4.1.11 with no pin, and a DO + hibernating WebSocket + SQLite test passed under it. Two documented constraints: WebSocket tests against DOs need per-file storage isolation off (hence `isolatedStorage: false`, `maxWorkers: 1`), and dynamic `import()` inside DO handlers fails under the plugin (none is used). Do not bump the repo to Vitest 5 (peer range excludes it). Worker test list: `init.test.ts`, `hand.test.ts` (two sockets via `SELF`, scripted hand to showdown), `leak.test.ts`, `alarm.test.ts` (`runDurableObjectAlarm(stub)` → auto-fold, bank consumption, forfeit after 3), `restore.test.ts` (evict + recreate between actions via `runInDurableObject`), `outbox.test.ts` (sink mode retry), `fuzz.test.ts` (random JSON and random legal/illegal `act` frames against the DO), `lobby.test.ts` (pair, limiter, no-show).

Playwright: existing specs untouched. `e2e/live.spec.ts` (`testMatch: /live/`, in the desktop and mobile projects): `playwright.config.ts` `webServer` becomes an array adding `{ command: 'npm run worker:dev -- --var DEV_AUTH_SECRET:e2e SUPABASE_URL:', url: 'http://localhost:8787/health' }`; two `browser.newContext()`s with `sessionStorage['qp.devToken'] = 'dev:alice:e2e'`/`'dev:bob:e2e'` injected via `addInitScript`, `?motion=off`; alice creates a match through the lobby's link action, bob opens it, both play one hand through the real `Table`/`ActionBar` DOM reusing `playHand` from `e2e/helpers.ts`, assert the keyboard loop, axe (desktop), no horizontal scroll (mobile), and tap every frame with `page.on('websocket')` to assert the opponent's ids never appear before `shown`.

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): `check` adds `npm run typecheck:worker` and `npm run worker:test` after `npm test`; `e2e` is unchanged apart from the second webServer. New `deploy-worker.yml` on push to `main`, `needs: [check, e2e]`, runs `cloudflare/wrangler-action@v3` with `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`/`CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` secrets and `command: deploy --config worker/wrangler.jsonc`. New `engine-soak.yml` weekly: `ENGINE_SOAK=1 npm run engine:soak`. Vercel keeps deploying the client from git; add `VITE_API_ORIGIN`, `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_KEY` to the project. Deployment order for a breaking protocol change: Worker first (accepts `qp.v1` and `qp.v2`), then Vercel; stored blobs carry `match.v` so a `TableDO` picks up new code on its next wake without migration.

## Migration path (ordered, each step shippable, with a rough day count totalling 2-3 weeks)

| Step                          | Days  | Deliverable (shippable at the end of the step)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Total: 15 working days of planned work (3 weeks), 3 days of reserve. The two-browser milestone lands before the lobby, the clock or the commitment so a slip in those does not move it.

## Risks and open questions (only ones the user must answer; everything else decide)

Risks owned by the design: engine correctness is the critical path (mitigated by the invariant suite before any UI, the N=2 oracle and the runtime halt); `toHeroGame` is a deliberate crutch that Phase 2 must retire with an N-seat `Table` (about a week, deferred not removed), and until then a human opponent is rendered with Atlas's drawn avatar and thinking ring (`AtlasAvatar.tsx`) under their own name — accepted Phase 0 cosmetic debt, to be replaced by a generic seat plate in step 4 only if it costs under half a day; players outside US-East see higher latency (one region is the PM's scope); DO hibernation/alarm semantics are new to the builder (the restore and alarm tests are the spike, scheduled on days 6–8); a corporate proxy that blocks WebSockets blocks play (no fallback transport); lobby polish is the most likely slip (it is three cards and ships after the milestone).

Questions for the user:

1. **Commitment scheme confirmation.** Per-slot commitment with partial reveal is chosen because full-deck reveal exposes every folded hand (contradicting `integrity-and-trust.md`'s "never ship unshown cards"). If you prefer the simpler full-deck reveal, say so and the PM must amend that rule; the code change is small either way, but it changes what `reveal` and `hands` carry, so it must be settled before day 11.
2. **Invite-by-link visibility.** It ships as the test harness regardless; should the lobby show "Play a friend by link" to users (my default: yes, secondary action) or hide it until the PM decides on private tables?
3. **Domain.** `api.<domain>` and the Vercel custom domain need the domain name; until then the Worker runs at `quantpoker-api.<account>.workers.dev` and `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` lists `quantpoker.vercel.app`. Also confirms the public-profile URL for Phase 1.
4. **Vercel Hobby terms.** Hobby is non-commercial use only; fine for a play-money ladder today, but confirm you are comfortable, or budget Vercel Pro ($20) alongside Supabase Pro ($25) when either trigger hits.
5. **Cloudflare account state.** Confirm the account is on Workers Paid (or will be before day 6) and has no legacy KV-backed DO namespace (irrelevant to a fresh account, but it changes the migration stanza).

## Out of scope for Phase 0

Rating, Glicko-2, accuracy grading and the population opponent model (Phase 1; the queue, `project.ts` and `bench.test.ts` are the seams). Duplicate segments (Phase 1; `DuplicateController`, `deck:<n>` retention and fresh secrets are the seams). Review → curriculum deep links beyond the street-level link (Phase 1). 6-max, dead-button rule, bots, arenas, `sit`/`stand`, table lists (Phase 2; same `TableDO`, `n` and `players` already generic). Spectating, preset chat, regional selection (P1). Muck at showdown. A normalised `actions` table. Cloud sync of Atlas practice through `SyncAdapter` (P2; `localAdapter` untouched). Anonymous sign-in. Tickets for WebSocket auth (only needed when public live links or spectating arrive). Delta protocol (the `seq` + `welcome` contract already permits it). Supabase local Docker stack and automated `db push`. Real money, tournaments, native apps, free-text chat, friends/clubs, multiway grading, KYC, auto-bans, multi-region.
