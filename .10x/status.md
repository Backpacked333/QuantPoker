# Project status

Last updated: 2026-10-10 by SDE (P1-03 live: rated tables show and send nothing to analyse; P1-04 next; S7-11 waits on U-4)

**Standing instructions from the user (2026-10-09):**

- **Merge when green.** Open a PR for each finished piece and merge it to `main` once CI passes. A merge deploys to production, so verify the deploy after each one.
- **Q1 is answered: B.** Rated heads-up uses fresh decks every hand, with the result luck-adjusted by settling all-in pots at equity.

## Phase 1 progress (2026-10-10)

Merged and deployed, each one verified in production after its merge:

- **PR #10 (`811c1e6`):** the Glicko-2 rating module (P1-11), the launch evidence, and the Q1 = B decision.
- **PR #11 (`a9272a7`):**
  - luck-adjusted results in the engine (P1-02);
  - archive calls that can never succeed are parked with an incident (S7-13);
  - the rated-match design: the ADR amendment, P1-00.
- **PR #12 (`6d1bad4`), the rated-match archive (P1-01, database).** Production recorded `20261010010000 rated_matches` through the Supabase integration on merge, and a read-only check confirmed the final `record_match` v4 body. It also fixed a flaky address-limit test at its cause: the burst straddled a wall-clock minute window.

**PR #13 (`c7c2558`), the rated match in the table server (P1-01b-1).** The deployed Worker code was confirmed through the Cloudflare connector, because `verify-deploy` cannot see Worker-only changes. **PR #14 (`485f998`): the 60 s grace and the both-gone void (P1-01b-2).** **PR #15 (`c6abcee`): the rated queue behind the confirmed-email gate, and the outcome in the end text (P1-01b-3).** **PR #16 (`e8ca36e`): the lobby's Rated card and the match bar (P1-01c).** **Rated play is live:** a signed-in player with a confirmed email can play rated from the lobby. Matches are archived only after U-4.

- 40 fresh-deck hands, with the bank refilling at hand 21.
- The luck is settled after each hand, and the archived record carries it.
- The outcome comes from the luck-adjusted total and the ±2 bb draw band. A forfeit is a loss.
- It also fixes a pre-existing outbox race that could strand a match's result.
- Nobody can start a rated match yet: the lobby queue opens in P1-01b-3, after the grace rule (P1-01b-2). Then comes the UI (P1-01c).

**PR #17 (`d042683`), nothing to analyse on a rated table (P1-03).** A rated table no longer draws the equity ring or the break-even figure. A full 40-hand rated match is proven to send no analysis key and no unshown opponent card, and the frame allowlists are compiler-checked against the protocol. Production serves the build (`verify-deploy`).

Q2 (when the third timeout forfeits) is unanswered. The build uses the recommendation, "immediately", which one rule can reverse.

## Phase

**Phase 0 milestone reached: two browsers play each other through the Worker.** Steps 1–6 of 7 done: quick-match lobby, shot clock with time bank and forfeit, provably fair deals ("Deck verified" in the browser), every hand archived to Postgres. Hosting is one Cloudflare Worker for site + game server; see the ADR amendment.

**Step 7 deployed 2026-10-09 23:31 UTC (PR #9 merged as `3cc9bd0` on your go).** Production serves the build, verified file by file, and both GitHub checks on `main` are green. Launch evidence: `.10x/reviews/2026-10-09-launch-verification.md`. The server now survives strangers and shows its failures:

- per-account frame and connect limits, oversize and illegal-frame closes with documented codes, invite caps and expiry, an address rate limit, and an Origin allowlist;
- every archived hand re-verified off the game path by a queue consumer, with incidents for anything that fails;
- card-free JSON logs with a sink test, hands/day at `/api/stats`, and a runbook;
- a CPU bench, pinned and least-privilege CI, a nightly seeded engine soak, a live-e2e guard and a deploy check;
- a 20-client smoke: 500 hands, p95 17 ms, 0 breaks;
- a chaos pass with 5/5 rows VERIFIED;
- players can verify their own folded cards;
- Fair play and Terms pages.

**Deploy prerequisites, 2026-10-09 (done in this session):**

- the DBA review ran;
- both new migrations are applied to production (`20261009213919 verify_hand`, `20261009213923 hands_created_index`);
- `wrangler deploy` now creates both queues itself;
- the Fair play report wording stays as written.

Still yours:

- **U-4:** the Worker's `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`, one real sign-in and one two-account match. Until then nothing is archived, and S7-11's last four rows stay open.
- **U-8:** the dashboard checks.

**DBA review 2026-10-09 (`.10x/reviews/2026-10-09-dba-review.md`):** no Critical or High open.

- **DB-1 (Medium) fixed and live.** `/api/stats` counted hands with full table scans, under a 3 s `anon` timeout. It now reads an index: 0.03 ms at 1M hands.
- **Retry safety proven** for repeats, failures part-way and reordering (PGlite), and for two sessions at once on a real PostgreSQL (8/8).
- **The Phase 1 schema is designed and measured** at 10k, 100k and 1M (`.10x/decisions/dba/phase1-schema.md`, `supabase/proposed/phase1.sql`; not applied). Eight defects in its first draft were fixed before anyone builds on it, including missing access rules.
- **Growth:** 4.9 kB per hand now, 6.5 kB with grades. The 8 GB disk lasts about 3 years at 1k hands/day.
- **New:** ticket S7-13 (Low), and questions Q6 and Q7 in tickets.

**Tickets 2026-10-09 (`.10x/tickets.md`):** the remaining plan is 49 tickets: Step 7 is 11, Phase 1 is 23, Phase 2 is 15. That is 134 half-days, about 90 session-hours at the measured Phase 0 pace. The ladder's critical path is 29.7 h; earliest ladder date 2026-10-13, planning date 2026-10-19. **Q1 is answered (B, 2026-10-09):** the same-pair duplicate format would let a player see the opponent's segment-2 cards, so rated play uses fresh decks with a luck adjustment.

**Security review 2026-10-09 (`.10x/reviews/2026-10-09-security-review.md`):** one High, three Medium and one Low fixed with red-then-green tests:

- lobby frame flood (High) and table frame flood (Medium);
- deck reveals that could hide a re-dealt card (Medium);
- dev tokens accepted with a short secret (Medium);
- the same-account join race (Low).

No Critical or High is open. Three Mediums are now Step 7 tickets: invite spam and storage growth, connection floods, and own folded cards being unverifiable (new S7-12). Held, with tests: auth, seat integrity, every frame type, a byte-equality side-channel test, and the full database access matrix. Four dashboard checks are yours (U-8 in tickets).

Supabase project `quantpoker` also carries an earlier line of work's schema (`20261007192620_learning_cloud`: `profiles`, `hand_results`, learning tables, AI-coach usage; all tables empty). Its migration file is now in the repo, byte-identical to production, so the repo and the live database have the same migrations (9 since 2026-10-09; the repo files carry the versions production recorded). Multiplayer tables are additive beside it.

## Repository (cleanup 2026-10-09)

- Default branch becomes **`main`** (the old default `devin/1791351254-quantpoker-learning-table` is renamed in GitHub settings, keeping its history). Cloudflare Workers Builds and the Supabase GitHub integration deploy from `main`. Vercel is retired.
- PR #8 (multiplayer Phase 0) lands as **one squash commit**; its 20 step commits stay readable on the PR page (`refs/pull/8/head`).
- PR #2 (Devin's earlier app line: AI coach, older learning studio, Vercel cloud saves) is **closed, not merged**; superseded by PR #7 and #8. Kept as `archive/context-aware-coach`, `archive/cinematic-poker`, `archive/supabase-vercel` and `refs/pull/{2,3,6}/head`. Pieces that exist only there, for a possible later port to the Worker: the AI coach (`server/coach.ts`, `src/lib/coach.ts`, `coach-stream.ts`) and the 3D terrain frontier/slice/camera (`Surface.tsx`, `terrain-camera.ts`).
- PR #5 (curriculum focus, atomic-save and memo fixes) is merged into `main`.
- All other branches had their content in the default branch already (checked by ancestry, patch equivalence and file content) and are deleted; tips archived as `archive/*` tags. A full mirror bundle of the repo before the cleanup was given to the user.
- Devin stays installed with PR monitoring turned off.

Note: `.10x/` was created this session. Discovery of the codebase was done inline by the PM (`[DISCOVERED]` entries in `.10x/decisions/product-manager/_index.md`) and verified by the Architect's design workflow. CTO strategic review has not run; the one build-vs-buy call (Cloudflare Durable Objects vs. a Node server vs. Supabase-only) was made by the user directly.

## Initiative

"Multiplayer QuantPoker": real online play-money poker between humans, chess.com-style rating + accuracy, public ladder/profile for quant talent. Two formats: heads-up duplicate and 6-max. Solo builder, AI-assisted, ship ASAP. Growth bet: curiosity + learning quant thinking through play; recruiters come months later.

## Stack (decided)

Site + game server: one Cloudflare Worker `quantpoker` (Workers Paid, Git-connected): static assets from the Vite build, `/api/*` and `/ws/*` to the Worker; Durable Objects (`TableDO` per match, `LobbyDO` singleton from Step 6), SQLite-backed, WebSocket hibernation, alarms. Auth + archive: Supabase project `quantpoker` in the Pro org "Quant Poker" (us-east-1, Postgres 17), ES256 JWTs verified in the Worker with `jose`. Grading (Phase 1): Cloudflare Queue consumer in the same Worker.

## Tasks

- [x] PM: problem, audience, constraints, success metrics; 5 feature specs; user alignment
- [x] Architect: Phase 0 system design (`.10x/decisions/architect/multiplayer-platform.md`) — engine, DOs, protocol, auth, data model, randomness/commitment, grading placement, client integration, lobby, failure modes, dev/CI, 7-step migration path, verified assumptions
- [ ] User: answer the 5 open questions in the ADR (commitment scheme, invite-link visibility, domain; the Vercel and Cloudflare-plan questions are settled: Cloudflare hosts everything) — `.10x/tickets.md` Q3 proposes closing the first three as built (per-slot commitment, link visible, `workers.dev` until a domain)
- [x] Staff Engineer / EM: tickets for Step 7, Phase 1 and Phase 2 with acceptance tests, critical path, lanes and metrics sources (`.10x/tickets.md`, 2026-10-09). Day-10 milestone was already reached in Step 4.
- [ ] User: the open questions in `.10x/tickets.md` (Q1 answered B; Q2 runs on the recommendation until you say otherwise; Q3–Q7 block nothing yet)
- [x] SDE: Step 1 — `src/engine/` + invariant, differential, redaction, commitment tests; `src/shared/protocol.ts`; `src/lib/presets.ts` (`.10x/decisions/sde/multiplayer-platform.md`). All gates green.
- [x] SDE: Step 2 — Supabase migrations applied (`players`, matches/hands archive, `record_hand`, FK index) with PGlite RLS tests; `#lobby` sign-in (email link; Google/GitHub when enabled), username, lobby shell; bundle guard; phone header fix. All gates green.
- [x] User: Cloudflare Workers Paid + Git-connected Worker; Supabase Pro org
- [ ] User: repo cleanup dashboard steps (rename default branch to `main`; Cloudflare and Supabase production branch → `main`; Cloudflare preview builds off; delete the Vercel project; Supabase Auth Site URL → workers.dev; optionally enable Google/GitHub) — see `.10x/handoff.md`
- [ ] SDE: first real sign-in on the deployed site, then decode the access token header and confirm `alg: ES256` (ADR day-5 check)
- [x] SDE: Step 3 — `worker/` + root `wrangler.jsonc`: `TableDO`, ES256 auth, invite-by-link matches, runtime `/api/config`; 9 Workers-runtime tests + a real two-client smoke run. All gates green.
- [x] SDE: Step 4 — live table in the browser (`src/net/client.ts`, `LiveTable`, `#play/<id>`, Play a friend by link); two-browser e2e against `wrangler dev`; full 20-hand match verified. All gates green.
- [x] SDE: Step 5 — turn clock + bank + auto check/fold + 3-timeout forfeit via one DO alarm; `hand_start` commitment, `hand_end` + `reveal`, in-browser "Deck verified" review; outbox → `record_match`/`record_hand` (new migration applied live, dry-run verified). 592 unit, 38 worker, 17 e2e; 20-hand smoke with a real 80 s timeout. (`.10x/decisions/sde/multiplayer-platform.md` §Step 5)
- [ ] User: create a Supabase secret key and add it to the Worker as `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` (until then nothing is archived)
- [x] SDE: Step 6 — `LobbyDO` quick-match (persisted queue, oldest-first pairing, ≤ 2 pairings per pair per day), one active table per account (queue resumes, invite 409/4409, self-healing), 30 s no-show (void match + abandonment; migration applied live), Find a match enabled with wait timer and 60 s bail-out. 605 unit, 52 worker, 18 e2e; real-time no-show smoke. (`.10x/decisions/sde/multiplayer-platform.md` §Step 6)
- [x] SDE: Step 7 build: limits, Origin allowlist, verify queue + DLQ, logs + sink test, bench, CI (pins, permissions, soak, live guard, deploy check), `/api/stats`, smoke, chaos pass, own-card verification, Fair play and Terms (`.10x/decisions/sde/multiplayer-platform.md` §Step 7). Not deployed
- [x] Before the Step 7 deploy (done 2026-10-09 on your "do that stuff"):
  - queues: `wrangler deploy` creates them, because both are named as producers; not yet seen on Workers Builds;
  - `verify_hand` and `hands_created_index` applied to production;
  - report contact: interim wording;
  - DBA review: done.
- [x] Step 7 deployed (PR #9 → `3cc9bd0`, 2026-10-09); `verify:deploy`, endpoints and the Origin allowlist VERIFIED in production
- [ ] User: U-4 (key, sign-in, one two-account match) to close S7-11; U-8 dashboard checks
- [ ] SDE: S7-05 (queue-wait and ack-latency telemetry) and S7-11 (launch gate, after your go)
- [x] QA: gap review of Steps 1–4 (`.10x/decisions/qa/multiplayer-platform.md`, `.10x/reviews/2026-10-08-qa-report.md`): 27 tests added (real ES256 auth, engine side pots at N=3–4, rejoin presence, live captions and offline states); 1 bug fixed (opponent shown disconnected after a rejoin). Gates: 577 unit, 25 worker, 17 e2e, all green. Release-ready for the invite-link beta; no blocking bugs.
- [x] Security: Phase 0 review, items 1–7 (`.10x/reviews/2026-10-09-security-review.md`, `.10x/decisions/security/multiplayer-platform.md`). Fixed SR-01 to SR-05; SR-06 to SR-13 are tickets or user actions with file:line.
- [ ] User: security dashboard checks U-8 in `.10x/tickets.md` (redirect allowlist, no `DEV_AUTH_SECRET` on the Worker, leaked-password protection, WAF rate limit)
- [x] DBA: Prompt 4 review of every migration plus the Phase 1 design (`.10x/reviews/2026-10-09-dba-review.md`, `.10x/decisions/dba/phase1-schema.md`).
  - DB-1 fixed and applied.
  - Retry safety: PGlite plus a real-Postgres concurrency script.
  - Growth model.
  - Phase 1 schema proposed, not applied.
- [ ] User: Q6 (grade visibility vs the Terms) before P1-09; Q7 (`hands_private` retention) whenever you like
- [x] SDE: S7-13 (park an archive call that can never succeed; PR #11)
- [x] SDE: P1-11 Glicko-2 (PR #10), P1-02 luck adjustment (PR #11), P1-00 design (PR #11), P1-01 database (PR #12, live)
- [x] SDE: P1-01b-1, the rated match in `TableDO` (PR #13, live)
- [x] SDE: P1-01b-2 grace and both-gone void (PR #14)
- [x] SDE: P1-01b-3 rated queue and email gate, with the outcome in the end text (PR #15)
- [x] SDE: P1-01c, the lobby's Rated card and the match bar (PR #16, live)
- [x] SDE: P1-03, nothing to analyse on a rated table (PR #17, live)
- [ ] Next in Phase 1: P1-04 end of match and rematch (in progress), P1-12 ratings (`ratings` migration, Glicko-2 at match end), S7-05 telemetry
- [ ] SDE: a build marker in `/api/health` so `verify-deploy` sees Worker-only changes
