        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>The server owns the cards.</b> Every deck is shuffled on the
            server with a cryptographic random generator. Your browser receives
            your own two cards, the board, and cards shown at showdown, never
            your opponent's hidden cards or the deck.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>The lab is never on at the live table.</b> No equity, ranges or
            expected values are computed or sent while a hand is played. The
            review comes after the hand.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Every deck is committed before the first card.</b> Your browser
            receives a fingerprint of all 52 cards in dealing order before the
            deal. After the hand the server opens the board, the shown hands and
            your own two cards, folded or not, and your browser checks each
            against that fingerprint ("Deck verified" in the hand review). That
            proves no card was changed after the deal. It does not prove the
            shuffle was fair: a biased shuffle could be committed honestly. The
            server also replays every recorded hand from its full deck to check
            the chips and the result.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Abandoning is counted.</b> Not opening a paired table within 30
            seconds, or missing three decisions in a row, ends the match and is
            recorded against that account. With rated play, abandoning will
            count against ladder eligibility.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>One table at a time per account,</b> and quick match pairs the
            same two accounts at most twice a day.

          <li>
            <b>Real-time assistance:</b> a solver, a bot or another person

        <p>
          Every action, its timing and every hand are recorded, so these checks
          can be applied to past play when they are built. We would rather say
          so than claim to catch what we do not.

      <Section id="fp-report" title="How to report">
        <p>
          Note the match link (the table's address, ending in{' '}
          <code>#play/…</code>) and the hand number from the hand review, and{' '}
          <Report />. A person reads every report. There are no automatic bans.
          With rated play, confirmed cheating means a rating reset and removal
          from the ladder, decided by a person, with one appeal.

          Play your own hands: no help from software or people during a hand, no

          Accounts and hand records are stored with Supabase in the United

          provided as it is and may change or stop. If the server ever finds a
          hand that breaks the rules of poker, it stops the match rather than
          pay out a wrong result.
