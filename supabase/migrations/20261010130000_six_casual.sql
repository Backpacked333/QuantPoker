-- P2-03a: casual 6-max sessions in the archive (ADR amendment 2026-10-10,
-- "Players in the archive", "Sessions in the archive"). One matches row per
-- table session, whose players change while it plays: a player sits down
-- after hand 1, stands up, sits again in another seat, and a freed seat goes
-- to someone else. So match_players is keyed by account, not seat; seat is
-- the last seat the account held, and who held a seat in a given hand is
-- read from that hand's record.seats, never from here. Additive for
-- heads-up: one more kind, the same rows, and record_match / record_hand
-- write exactly what they wrote before for every heads-up payload.
--
-- Locks (DBA review in the commit). Both tables are locked in the order the
-- archive's writes lock them (matches, then match_players), so an archive
-- call waiting behind this migration cannot deadlock with it. A lock still
-- queued after 5 s fails the migration instead of holding up every reader
-- behind it; it is then simply re-run.
-- Rollback (only while no six-casual match is archived; delete those first,
-- which cascades to their players and hands):
--   alter table public.match_players
--     drop constraint match_players_pkey,
--     add constraint match_players_pkey primary key (match_id, seat),
--     add constraint match_players_match_id_user_id_key unique (match_id, user_id);
--   alter table public.matches drop constraint matches_kind_check,
--     add constraint matches_kind_check check (kind in ('hu-casual', 'hu-rated'));
--   then restore the functions: the record_match statement of
--   20261010043000_rematch.sql (v5) and the record_hand statement of
--   20261008134322_record_hand.sql (v1, as create or replace); and
--   delete from supabase_migrations.schema_migrations
--     where version = '20261010130000';
--   so a later db push does not treat this migration as applied.
set local lock_timeout = '5s';

-- The same NOT VALID then VALIDATE as rated_matches: matches is small, so
-- the scan under the drop's exclusive lock takes milliseconds.
alter table public.matches drop constraint matches_kind_check;
alter table public.matches
  add constraint matches_kind_check
  check (kind in ('hu-casual', 'hu-rated', 'six-casual'))
  not valid;
alter table public.matches validate constraint matches_kind_check;

-- The key moves from (match_id, seat) to (match_id, user_id), which was
-- already unique: no row can fail it, and the new index replaces the old
-- unique one under the same columns. One statement, so one exclusive lock
-- and one index build. match_id still leads the key, so the cascade from
-- matches and every per-match read (record_grades by seat, the hand_grades
-- policy, refresh_finished_match) keep an index; match_players_user and
-- match_players_history are untouched. (match_id, seat) is no longer
-- unique: two accounts can have held one seat in a session. Heads-up rows
-- still never share one, since both calls below take seats from payloads
-- that name the same two seats every time.
alter table public.match_players
  drop constraint match_players_pkey,
  drop constraint match_players_match_id_user_id_key,
  add constraint match_players_pkey primary key (match_id, user_id);

-- v6: exactly v5 (rematch), plus:
-- - every call to a match in play upserts its players by account, with the
--   seat they hold now (v5 inserted on the first call only, so a player who
--   sat down later had no row). A heads-up call names the same two seats
--   every time, so its upsert writes nothing. Calls to a match that is over
--   still change nothing;
-- - six-casual: timeouts are keyed by account (a session total), nobody is
--   marked abandoned and no abandonments row is written. A seat may have had
--   several players in one session, and a six table forfeits nobody.
